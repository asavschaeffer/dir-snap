# Directory Mapper & Scaffolder

A simple Python utility with a Tkinter GUI to help manage directory structures, primarily designed for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Description

This tool has two main functions:

1.  **Snapshot (Directory -> Map):** Scans an existing directory on your filesystem and generates a text-based map representing its structure (files and folders). This map is easy to copy and paste into LLM chats for context.
2.  **Scaffold (Map -> Directory):** Takes a text-based directory map (like one an LLM might provide) and creates the corresponding directory structure and empty files on your filesystem.

## Current Status (MVP - Work In Progress)

This is currently a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Core features are working, but more enhancements and robust error handling are planned.

## Features (Current MVP)

- **Snapshot:**
  - Generates a directory map using 2-space indentation.
  - Adds a trailing `/` to directory names in the map.
  - Includes default ignore patterns (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`).
  - Allows adding custom ignore patterns (comma-separated) per run.
  - Option to automatically copy the map to the clipboard on generation (defaults to off).
  - Buttons to manually copy map or save it to a `.txt` file.
  - Basic status feedback.
- **Scaffold:**
  - Parses maps matching the specific format generated by the Snapshot tool (2-space indent, trailing `/` for dirs).
  - Creates the directory structure and empty files within a selected base directory.
  - Allows pasting map text from clipboard or loading from a `.txt` file.
  - Provides status feedback (Ready, Creating, Success, Error).
- **GUI:**
  - Simple `tkinter` interface with tabs for Snapshot and Scaffold modes.
  - File/Directory browser integration.
- **Context Handling:**
  - Can be launched with a directory path (starts Snapshot mode).
  - Can be launched with a file path (starts Scaffold mode, attempts to load file).
  - Can be launched targeting a base directory for scaffolding ("Create Here" workflow - requires context menu setup).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (developed on 3.x, likely compatible with 3.7+)
- `tkinter` (usually included with Python standard library)
- `pyperclip` (for clipboard access)

## How to Run (from Source - Current State)

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd DirectoryMapper
    ```
2.  (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    - You can also test the core logic directly (without GUI) using the test harness within `dirmapper/logic.py`: `python -m dirmapper.logic`

## Future Goals / Planned Features

- Support for multiple Snapshot output formats (e.g., `tree`-style).
- Support for parsing multiple Scaffold input formats (Tree, Tabs, Generic fallback) with auto-detection.
- Persistent configuration file for ignores, paths, and preferences.
- File type emojis in Snapshot output.
- Packaging using `PyInstaller` for easier distribution.
- User-friendly installer (e.g., Inno Setup) including optional right-click context menu setup.
- Further UI/UX refinements and improved error handling.

Remember to create a `requirements.txt` file containing just:

```

pyperclip

```

This should give you a good starting point for your GitHub repository! Let me know when you're ready to tackle the next steps on our list.
